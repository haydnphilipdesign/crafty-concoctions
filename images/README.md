This folder contains placeholder references for images used in the Crafty Concoctions landing page.

## Required Images

### Hero Section
- **hero-mobile-bar.jpg** (Recommended size: 800x600px)

  - Should showcase elegant bar equipment and setup
  - High-quality, well-lit photo that represents the brand

## Image Guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display on all devices
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web to ensure fast loading
- **Alt Text**: Already included in HTML for accessibility

### Style Guidelines
- **Professional**: Clean, well-composed shots
- **Brand Consistent**: Should match the upscale, festive brand personality
- **Lighting**: Well-lit, vibrant images that convey celebration

## Current Status
- The site currently uses CSS-generated placeholder backgrounds
- Replace placeholder styling in `styles.css` once real images are added
- Remove the `::before` pseudo-element styling for `.hero-img` when adding real images

## Adding Images
1. Place image files in this folder
2. Update the `src` attributes in `index.html` if filenames differ
3. Remove placeholder styling from `styles.css`
4. Test across different screen sizes to ensure proper display

## Future Enhancements
Consider adding:
- Gallery of past events
- Team photos
- Additional service showcase images
- Customer testimonial photos
